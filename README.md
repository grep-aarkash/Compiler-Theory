# Compiler-Theory
This repo is for my own personal use. 

It contains the two assignments which I completed for my Compiler-Theory course.

It also contains the papers I read and the notes I made during the discussions of those papers. 

It also contains short summaries and critiques of the papers which I read. 

Finally, this repo also contains my final research project for Compiler-Theory course, where I try to prove compiler correctness.
